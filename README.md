## Engineering Priorities

The architecture follows the following engineering priorities:

```
Quality
      ↓
Reliability
      ↓
Security
      ↓
Cost
      ↓
Latency
```

The system is designed with healthcare data in mind, following security best practices for handling **PHI (Protected Health Information)** and **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)** while keeping future HIPAA-oriented deployments in consideration.
